## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thibaut, I'm a Ruby on Rails developer from France.

Iâ€™m currently working on a side project aimed at helping people share and pool useful contacts.

Few of my open source contributions:

- [Maybe](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/commits/main/?author=ThibautGrx)

- [Ekylibre](https://github.com/ekylibre/ekylibre/commits/main/?author=ThibautGrx)

- More to come!
